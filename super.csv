"Tonight, tonight I disappear"
"Behind, I leave it all behind"
"Walking, facing things head on"
"Maybe I won’t return, ever"
Tomorrow brings what it brings
"Whatever will be, will be"
At the end of the story
Everything ends where it begins
"To the horizon, without direction"
"Tonight, tonight I disappear"
"Behind, I leave it all behind"
"Walking, facing things head on"
"Maybe I won’t return, ever"
Tomorrow brings what it brings
"Whatever will be, will be"
At the end of the story
Everything ends where it begins
"To the horizon, without direction"
Three thousand years may go by
You may kiss other lips
But I’ll never forget you
I may die tomorrow
My soul may dry out
But I’ll never forget you
They may erase my memory
They may steal your history
But I’ll never forget you
How could I forget your smile?
How could I forget your eyes?
How could I forget I used to pray?
So you wouldn’t leave
How could I forget your crazy ways?
How could I forget you used to soar?
How could I forget I still love you?
"More than life, more than anything"
Three thousand years may go by
You may kiss other lips
But I’ll never forget you
You may throw me out your life
You may deny that you love me
But I’ll never forget you
I know I’ll never forget you
How can I forget your smile?
How could I forget your eyes?
How could I forget I used to pray?
So you wouldn’t leave
How could I forget your crazy ways?
How could I forget you used to soar?
How could I forget I still love you?
"More than life, more than anything"
Three thousand years may go by
You may kiss other lips
But I’ll never forget you
"Skeletons don’t cry, serenade of love"
"Skeletons don’t cry, they don’t have hearts"
"Skeletons don’t cry, serenade of love"
"I dreamt another world, so far, so near"
"I dreamt another voyage, four paths, five destinies"
"I dreamt of laughter, of illusion"
"I dreamt of another world, I dreamt of less struggle"
I dreamt of a morning when it was finally possible
"I dreamt of a love, of night and day"
"I dreamt of good fortune, I dreamt of joy"
"Skeletons don’t cry, serenade of love"
"Skeletons don’t cry, they don’t have hearts"
"I dreamt without war, I dreamt without fears"
"I dreamt without fences, I dreamt without beatings"
I dreamt of hard work that never ends
I dreamt of a festival that was always going on
"Skeletons don’t cry, serenade of love"
"Skeletons don’t cry, they don’t have hearts"
"I dreamt of working, I dreamt until I got sick"
"So far and so close. Pacific, I dreamt of your waves"
"So far and close. Eventually, you have to get there"
"Skeletons don’t cry, serenade of love"
"Eventually, you have to get there. Skeletons don’t cry"
"I dreamt of another world, I dreamt of obtaining it"
"I obtained it dreaming, I dreamt as I woke up"
Skeletons don’t cry
So far and close
Skeletons don’t cry
So far and close
"Eventually, you have to get there"
"Skeletons don’t cry, serenade of love"
"Eventually, you have to get there"
Skeletons don’t cry
Where is that Indian that existed in ancient times?
"Through South, Central and North America,"
Left us his heritage
The Indian was a marvel
His science was unequaled
To care and love the earth
To live in harmony with nature
But the reign of that Indian
"Innocent, he died. But, that Indian"
"That Indian is not dead, no"
"Because his,"
his is the blood I carry
"I carry, I carry"
From the ancient one is blood that I carry
"Now, I sing with pride"
Never will I be moved
"Because, always lives the ancient blood"
"And, there is no one in this world that can impede it"
Because forever will live the ancient blood
It is the one people beneath the sun
God made us with valiant souls
"And he gave us the most potent weapons,"
Love and heart
Along the road by my house
A cheerful cart driver passes
With his sentimental songs
The cheerful guajira sang
"I am going to the crossing, to unburden my load"
There I’ll reach the end of my crushing labor
"Ride up the mountain, ride up the mountain"
"I work without rest, so I can marry"
"And, if I achieve that, I’ll be a happy man"
"Ride up the mountain, ride up the mountain"
I am a guajiro and a cart driver
I live well off the land
I am a guajiro and a cart driver
I live well off the land
Because the countryside is paradise
The most beautiful place on earth
"Ride up the mountain, ride up the mountain"
"Work the mountain, cultivate the plain"
Reap the fruits of your labor
"Work the mountain, cultivate the plain"
Reap the fruits of your labor
"If just once, I could give you goose-bumps"
"To burn, I don’t know, your mouth"
And die there later on
"And then, you would tremble for me"
And cry to see my suffering
"And without a doubt, give your whole life up"
Like I give it up for you
If I could be your hero
If I be could your god
What saved you a thousand times
Could be my salvation
If you knew
the madness I carry
That hurts me and kills me inside
And what difference does it make?
I think at the end
What counts is that I love you
If I could be your hero
If I be could your god
What saved you a thousand times
Could be my salvation
Let me touch you
I want to caress you
Once more
I think at the end
What counts is that I love you
If I could be your hero
If I be could your god
What saved you a thousand times
Could be my salvation
I want to be your hero
If I be could your god
What saved you a thousand times
Could be my salvation
I want to be your hero
Let me touch you
I want to caress you
Once more
I think at the end
What counts is that I love you
If I could be your hero
If I could be your god
What saved you a thousand times
Could be my salvation
"In Dawson, New Mexico, on the tenth of April"
Dolores Huerta was born
No one imagined that she would lead
Part of the great movement
"In Stockton, California, where she was raised"
She began to see the injustice
That the farm worker has suffered without
The representation that a union would give him
"I remember there in Delano, in ’62"
She began her association with Cesar Chavez
"And between him and Dolores, they formed"
A union that came to change the laws
Her feelings as a woman
Were guided in the proper direction
The best thing to happen to the modest farm worker
Her feelings as a woman
Gave strength to the union
"You have earned the flower of peace, Dolores Huerta!"
"I sleep and wake up, while I dream"
"And go across time, back to the first yesterday"
Amid the dawn’s earliest light
"Born of others, a memory awaits"
It returns me to the first footprint
When life began in Africa
Eleggua travels upon a star
And opens the road that leads to America
Eleggua opens the road
"From Lara’s clan, from the land of Arara"
Eleggua opens the road
"Life flowing from Africa, our original fountain"
Eleggua opens the road
"From a world without a past, without frontiers or foreigners"
Eleggua opens the road
"When everything was beginning,"
when money didn’t exist
Skin is pure geography
The soul in change is a universal project
The blood of the world that feeds us
"From the first born on, the original source"
Eleggua opens the road
"If blood would flow, when flesh and steel are one"
Drying in the colors of the evening sun
Tomorrow’s rain will wash the stains away
There’s something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime’s argument
That nothing comes from violence
And nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are
"On and on, the rain will fall like tears from a star"
"On and on, the rain will say, how fragile we are"
"On and on, the rain will fall like tears from a star"
"On and on, the rain will say, how fragile we are"
"Tonight, tonight I disappear"
"Behind, I leave it all, behind"
"Walking, my sights set ahead"
"Maybe I won’t return, ever"
Tomorrow brings what it brings
"Whatever will be, will be"
At the end of the story
Everything ends where it begins
"To the horizon, without direction"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Trying to take you far from here
Following the road of the moon’s voice
A reason does not exist for me to leave
I’ll take with me my fortune
And that is you my dear
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
I’m trying to take you to another place
Where we can forget our bitterness
And even if the real truth does not exist
I want to take my sincerity
Hugging this craziness
Which is you my dear
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering and pure
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
My heart is smoldering
With the edge of a coin
"Lost on the road, don’t"
Don’t blame me for everything that happens
Migra! In the mountains and the hills
Minutemen looking for fear ready to shoot you
Migra! They want to find someone
To give them an American bullet to retaliate
It’s because they can’t take the prophecy
The people come day after day
Migra! I don’t care if they take me
I’ll be back with more strength to organize
"Migra! Like in China, they build a wall"
"To evade the Mexican, nightmare of the Texan"
If you don’t have anybody to immigrate you
"Those easy, easy go"
Let’s quickly call the witnesses
"That those easy, easy go"
If you don’t have anybody to immigrate you
"That those easy, easy go"
Let’s quickly call the witnesses
"Those easy, easy go"
If you don’t have anybody to immigrate you
"Those easy, easy go"
Let’s quickly call the witnesses
"That those easy, easy go"
If you don’t have anybody to immigrate you
"Those easy, easy go"
Let’s quickly call the witnesses
"That those easy, easy go"
Life is a track of successes and failures
Shaped by bits of love and pain
Time is a rosary
"Its beads, the memories"
"Garden of feelings, from what was lived"
There is a time for laughing
And other time to cry
A time to leave
And another one to come back
There is a time to live
And another one to finish
There’s a time to die
And another one to start
When the time comes
For the end of my journey
Let my smile say
That I accept what I was
The material things
I’ll leave with you
I will only take with me what I’ve learned
That there’s a time to give
And another to receive
A time to think
And other one to decide
That there’s a time to forget
And another one to understand
There’s a time to win
And another to lose
There’s a time for suffering
"And, there’s a time to live"
A time to feel
And another one to forgive
There’s a time to live
And another one to finish
There’s a time to die
And another one to start
